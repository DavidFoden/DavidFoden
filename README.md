# Hello, Earthlings! 👋

I'm David Foden, a code wizard 🧙‍♂️ from Earth, currently working on projects with some extremely unique clients on the exoplanet Kepler-452b.

## About Me 🚀

In the vast and seemingly endless cosmos, a series of encrypted signals were intercepted by our ground control. These signals were not just from any corner of the universe, but from Kepler-452b, an exoplanet eerily similar to our own.

The signals were a call for help, a plea to resolve some tricky, mind-boggling tech conundrums that even the most sophisticated Keplerian tech geniuses were struggling with. Always up for a challenge and fueled by an unending curiosity, I embarked on an interstellar journey to assist these extraterrestrial beings.

Once I landed on Kepler-452b, to my utter surprise, I was greeted by none other than the Teletubbians! Yes, you read it right, those adorable creatures we adored on television, were, in fact, aliens from this far-off planet. Who would've guessed!

In reality, they are some of the most advanced species in the universe and their technology is way beyond our Earthly comprehension. However, with their technologies, emerged new complexities, and that's where I came in, as an interstellar software engineer.

## My Stellar Projects 🌌

- **Sun Baby Solar API**: A cutting-edge API that powers their Sun Baby - the solar power source for the entire planet of Kepler-452b.
- **Tubby Custard Cloud Infrastructure**: Designed a resilient cloud-based infrastructure to handle their Tubby Custard Machine, which is vital to their daily sustenance.
- **Noonoo Cleanup Protocol**: An automated cleanup protocol for their resident A.I., Noonoo, improving efficiency by 300%.

## Tech Stack 🛸

Here on Kepler-452b, the tech stack is an intriguing fusion of Earth and Teletubbian technology:

```js
{
  languages: ['Javascript', 'Typescript', 'Python', 'Rudy', 'C#', 'C++', 'TubbyScript'],
  databases: ['MongoDB', 'Firebase', 'CosmosDB', 'TubbyDB'],
  tools: ['React', 'Node', 'Express', 'Docker', 'TubbyDocker']
}
